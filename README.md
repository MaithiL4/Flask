Learning Flask from basics 

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. 

Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest and LinkedIn.

We need to Install Flask First. In terminal type pip install flask.
